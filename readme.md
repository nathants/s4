# s4

## why

s3 is awesome, but can be expensive, slow, and doesn't expose data local compute or efficient shuffle.

## what

an s3 cli compatible storage cluster that is cheap and fast, with data local compute and efficient shuffle.

data local compute maps arbitrary commands over immutable keys in 1:1, n:1 and 1:n operations.

data shuffle is implicit in 1:n mappings.

server placement is based on the hash of basename or a numeric prefix.

| key | method | placement |
| -- | -- | -- |
| s4://bucket/dir/name.txt | int(hash("name.txt")) | ? |
| s4://bucket/dir/000_bucket0.txt | int("000") | 0 |
| s4://bucket/dir/000 | int("000") | 0 |

keys are strongly consistent and cannot be updated unless first deleted.

## when

use this for efficiently processing ephemeral data.

keep durable inputs, outputs, and checkpoints in s3.

## how

a ring of servers store files on disk.

a metadata controller on each server orchestrates out of process operations for data transfer and local compute.

a cli client coordinates cluster activity.

## non goals

high availability. every key lives on one and only one server.

high durability. data lives on a single disk, and is as durable as that disk.

security. data transfers are checked for integrity, but not encrypted. service access is unauthenticated. secure the network with [wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) if needed.

fine granularity. data should be medium to coarse granularity.

safety for all inputs. service access should be considered to be at the level of root ssh. any user input should be escaped for shell.

cluster resizing. clusters should be short lived and data ephemeral. instead of resizing create a new cluster.

pagination of list results. data layout and partitioning must be considered.

go get:

```bash

## usage

### s4 rm
```
usage: s4 rm [-h] [-r] prefix

    delete data from s4.

    - recursive to delete directories.


positional arguments:
  prefix           -

optional arguments:
  -h       show this help message and exit
  -r       False
```

### s4 eval
```
usage: s4 eval [-h] key cmd

### s4 cp
```
usage: s4 cp [-h] [-r] src dst
